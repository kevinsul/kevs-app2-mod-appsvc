# Security Best Practices

## ?? Security Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Kev's Inventory Management Application.

## ? Implemented Security Features

### 1. Azure Key Vault Integration
- **Connection Strings**: Stored securely in Azure Key Vault
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All sensitive data retrieved from Key Vault
- **Secret Rotation**: Supports automatic secret rotation without code changes

### 2. Managed Identity Authentication
- **Passwordless Authentication**: Uses Azure Managed Identity
- **No Credentials in Code**: No connection strings or passwords in source code
- **RBAC Enabled**: Role-based access control for Key Vault access

### 3. Database Security
- **TLS Encryption**: All database connections use TLS 1.2+
- **Firewall Rules**: Configured to allow only Azure services
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Uses parameterized queries via Entity Framework Core
- **Input Validation**: Model validation on all user inputs

### 4. Application Security
- **HTTPS Only**: Application enforces HTTPS with HSTS
- **Secure Headers**: Security headers configured in middleware
- **CORS Policy**: Configured for specific origins
- **Error Handling**: Generic error pages in production (no sensitive info leaked)

## ?? Important Security Notes

### Before Deploying to Production

1. **Review App Settings**
   - Ensure `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` is set to `Production`
   - Verify Key Vault name is correctly configured
   - Check Managed Identity is properly assigned

2. **Database Access**
   - Use Managed Identity for database authentication (recommended)
   - If using SQL authentication, rotate passwords regularly
   - Limit SQL Server firewall rules to specific IP ranges

3. **Key Vault Access**
   - Grant least-privilege access (Secrets User role only)
   - Enable Key Vault audit logging
   - Configure access policies for specific identities only

4. **Application Insights**
   - Review telemetry data for sensitive information
   - Configure data masking if needed
   - Enable application-level logging filters

## ?? Security Checklist

Before going to production, verify:

- [ ] All secrets stored in Key Vault (no hardcoded credentials)
- [ ] Managed Identity configured and tested
- [ ] HTTPS enforced on App Service
- [ ] TLS 1.2 minimum on all connections
- [ ] SQL Server firewall configured
- [ ] Key Vault access policies set to least privilege
- [ ] Application Insights configured with appropriate filters
- [ ] Error pages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] CORS configured for specific origins
- [ ] Input validation enabled on all forms

## ?? Regular Security Maintenance

### Monthly Tasks
- Review Key Vault access logs
- Check Application Insights for anomalies
- Verify firewall rules are still appropriate
- Review Managed Identity permissions

### Quarterly Tasks
- Rotate SQL admin passwords
- Review and update dependencies
- Check for security updates
- Conduct security review

### Annual Tasks
- Full security audit
- Penetration testing (if applicable)
- Review and update security policies
- Update disaster recovery plans

## ??? Security Incident Response

If you suspect a security incident:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Revoke compromised credentials immediately
   - Check Key Vault access logs for unauthorized access
   - Review Application Insights for suspicious activity
   - Disable affected Managed Identities if necessary

2. **Investigation**
   - Review all access logs from the time period
   - Check database activity logs
   - Review firewall logs
   - Document all findings

3. **Remediation**
   - Rotate all affected secrets
   - Update firewall rules
   - Patch any vulnerabilities
   - Update security policies

4. **Post-Incident**
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update security procedures
   - Conduct team training if needed
   - Consider additional monitoring

## ?? Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to: [your-security-email@example.com]
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

We aim to respond within 24 hours for critical issues.
