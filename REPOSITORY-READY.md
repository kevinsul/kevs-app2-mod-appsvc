## ?? Upload to GitHub - Quick Steps

### 1. Prepare the README
```bash
# Rename the GitHub-ready README
mv README-GITHUB.md README.md
```

### 2. Initialize Git (if needed)
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Inventory Management App with Azure Key Vault"
```

### 3. Create GitHub Repository
- Go to: https://github.com/new
- Name: `inventory-management-app` (or your choice)
- **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we have them)
- Click "Create repository"

### 4. Push to GitHub
```bash
# Add remote (replace with your URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/inventory-management-app.git

# Push to main branch
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 5. Configure Repository
- Add description: "ASP.NET Core 8.0 MVC Inventory Management with Azure Key Vault"
- Add topics: `aspnetcore`, `azure`, `keyvault`, `mvc`, `sql-server`, `bicep`
- Enable Issues for bug tracking

## ?? What's Excluded from Git

The `.gitignore` file properly excludes:
- ? Build artifacts (`bin/`, `obj/`)
- ? User-specific settings
- ? Azure environment data (`.azure/**/` except docs)
- ? Migration tracking files (`.appmod/`)
- ? Secrets and credentials
- ? Downloaded logs and temp files

---

## ? Pre-Upload Verification

Run these commands to verify everything is ready:

```bash
# Check what will be committed
git status

# Verify no secrets in staged files
git diff --cached | grep -i "password\|secret\|key"

# Verify .gitignore is working
ls -la bin/ obj/ .azure/kevs-inventory-prod/
# These should not exist in git
```
